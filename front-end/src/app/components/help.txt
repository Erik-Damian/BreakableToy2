This entire directory holds all the components for the project.

They are divided in 3 different directories, with their owwn subdirectives inside each.

These are:

-   atoms: By definition, the smallest components that can't be broken down further. Holds single components such as texts, containers and more.
-   molecules: A collection of atoms formin a single component. An example is a form control that has the control itself and a text.
-   organisms: An array of molecules forming a single component. Generally reserved for more complex components that require functionality. Such as forms and more.

These subdirectories are used loosely to organize each component. But this does not restrict any of them from being used in any order
or with other contexts. 
The components hold in each also aren't locked by their division. You can, if you want, use an atom in an organism if it needs it, or 
in a full screen. But best practice would be to only have a couple of components per component or screen, so be mindful when building
something new.

IMPORTANT if a component has functionality, you should try and put it under organisms, regardless if it can be broken down or not.
There are single celled organisms in nature too.
